# self_driving_car

This script allows you to have a self-driving vehicle in GTA V. By vehicle, I mean the scooter because normal cars were too quick. 

Main Libraries:

    - OpenCV to get a live feed of the game, 
    - Tensorflow to analyze test/train screenshots of the lane edges
    - Tensorflow Object Detection API to detect other cars
    - DirectKeys to feed input back into the game
